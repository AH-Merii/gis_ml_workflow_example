# gis_ml_workflow_example

The above notebook provides an example of how to work with raster & vector files using some of the most popular open source libraries such as geopandas, shapely, rasterio etc...

In addition to interacting with raster files, the notebook will demonstrate how to use Solaris to carry out semantic segmentation on the buildings in the raster file.

The above is a work in progress and will be updated to include more examples such as: 

* Creating chips from a larger raster image.
* Finetuning a model
* Creating a model from scratch


# Solaris Building Segmentation Output

## Using Conda

`conda create env -n env_name -f environment_solaris.yml python 3.8.6`

`conda activate env_name`

## Using Docker

Navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file: `docker_solaris/`

Run the commands below in your terminal

`docker-compose up -d`

`docker-compose logs`

Extract the notebook address from the command above and run it in the environment of your choice.

Open the `solaris_building_segmentation_output_example.ipynb`<br>



# Cresi Road Segmentation Output

## Using Docker

Navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose,yml` file: `docker_cresi/`

Run the commands below in your terminal

`docker-compose up -d`

`docker-compose logs`

Extract the notebook address from the command above and run it in the environment of your choice.

* Place the `Ortho_Sample.tif` file inside the `data\cresi` directory.
* Place the output csv file `wkt_vectors.csv` that was generated by running the cresi baseline model on `Ortho_Sample.tif` inside of the `data\cresi` directory.

Open and run the `cresi_output_example.ipynb`<br>

An `map.html` file should be generated inside of the `data\cresi` directory.

Open the `map.html` file in a browser to visualize your output using `leaflet.js`
